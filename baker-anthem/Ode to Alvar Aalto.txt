​O Baker House, my Baker Home,
Beloved Place where I am from:
When, every Sunday, Baker talks,
and bring we cups for Baker Bucks


As by and by our P-Sets grow,
We try, and sigh, and then we go
to Study Breaks, to Live, and roam--
O Baker House!--My Baker Home!


O Baker House, my Baker Home,
Beloved Place where I am from:
Our Institute 'cross inky tar;
across the river, nothing's far.


Though I may leave for holiday,
my heart won't part while I'm away,
and when I have all else outgrown,
I yet will have my Baker Home!


O Baker House, my Baker Home,
Beloved Place where I am from:
With autumn, we arrive with cheer;
In winter, we take shelter here;


Come spring, we loose a piano fall:
One mon' from done, we gather all--
What soul, what firm resolve we've shown,
O Baker House--my Baker Home!


O Baker House, my Baker Home,
Beloved Place where I am from:
Where yearn to change the world we all
with influence like a child small


Yet, all so, all things understood,
our time is prime as childhood
I will persist, like brick, like stone,
Persist like--Oh!--my Baker Home!

O Baker House, my Baker Home,
Beloved Place where I am from:
Though P-Sets always weigh on me
Some sweet times, I feel light and free.


Now ends abrupt another year,
Yet still I will be surely here
O paradise!--O stolid dome!
O Baker House!--my Baker Home!
